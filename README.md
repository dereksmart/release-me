# release-me
Scripts that hopefully help in managing and shipping WordPress plugin release flows on GitHub and SVN. 

Get started with `./release-me -h`

You can test like this: 
- Fork the VaultPress Repo in your GH account
- Clone this repo anywhere
- `cd` to this repo
- `./release-me -n -o="yourgithubusername" -p="vaultpress"` - Will create a new set of release branches in your fork.
- `./release-me -u -o="yourgithubusername" -p="vaultpress"` - Will update the release branch
