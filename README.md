# release-me
Scripts that hopefully help in managing and shipping WordPress plugin release flows on GitHub and SVN. 

Get started with `./release-branch.sh -h`

You can test like this: 
- Fork the VautPress Repo in your GH account
- Clone this relase-me repo anywhere
- `cd` to this repo
- `./release-branch.sh -n -o="yourgithubusername" -p="vaultpress"` - Will create a new set of release branches in your fork.
- `./release-branch.sh -u -o="yourgithubusername" -p="vaultpress"` - Will update the release branch
